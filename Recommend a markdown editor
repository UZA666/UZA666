##      **推荐一款markdown编辑器**

####   总之，也许每个版本之间的变化幅度很小，但多年积累下来，Typora 已经全然改换了面貌。依我说，想充分体验这个简洁而强大的工具，也许唯一的方法，就是自己下载来尝试一番。

   **Recommend a markdown editor**

#### The markdown editor I recommend is ***typora***. It has a simple interface, easy to use, fast startup, and supports a variety of markdown syntax and shortcut keys, making editing and typesetting convenient. In addition, it is very useful, with powerful export functions and many customization options, allowing users to better personalize their editor. It has the most prominent feature: "what you see is what you get", that is, what you edit, what you give back. Compared to other markdown editors, its operation logic is similar to Word, but it is still relatively simple and easy to use. It has a wide range of theme templates and styles:

#### In short, there may be a small amount of change between each version, but over the years, Typora has completely changed its face. In my opinion, perhaps the only way to get the most out of this simple yet powerful tool is to download it yourself and try it out.
